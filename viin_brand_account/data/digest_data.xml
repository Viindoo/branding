                        ” option to post invoices automatically. For the
                        cost of a local stamp, we do all the manual
                        work: your invoice will be printed in the right
                        country, put in an envelop and sent by snail
                        mail. Use this feature from the list view to
                        post hundreds of invoices in bulk.
