            Define your locations to reflect your warehouse structure and
            organization. The system is able to manage physical locations
            (warehouses, shelves, bin, etc), partner locations (customers,
            vendors) and virtual locations which are the counterpart of
            the stock operations like the manufacturing orders
            consumptions, inventories, etc.
          </p><p>
            Every stock operation in Viindoo moves the products from one
            location to another one.  For instance, if you receive products
            from a vendor, the system will move products from the Vendor
            location to the Stock location. Each report can be performed on
            physical, partner or virtual locations.
